See http://www.wolfire.com/receiver for more about this game. This repository is public for convenience and for personal use, but is not licensed for redistribution in whole or in part. We are open to issuing free permissive licenses for mods or code pieces, but you will just have to get our permission first ( contact@wolfire.com ), because we were burnt in the past by public confusion about open-source licensing. ( See http://blog.wolfire.com/2011/02/Counterfeit-Lugaru-on-Apple-s-App-Store-developing for more about this ). Thank you for understanding!

Enemby's response:
I've emailed this contact email and received no reply, and it's been a long time.
I've started showing the repo around, because to my knowledge, I haven't broken any rules by keeping it on github.
This fork requires Unity5 or above, but you should probably just use unity5.0.
The goal of this branch was to update the game to Unity5, so others could use this as a jumping off point for their mods.
I had more plans for it, but after I couldn't get permission to release it...
I put the project on hiatus.

Yesterday Wolfire came out with an update, making this repo obsolete.
So, there's that.
